# Recursion means calling a function or a method within itself.
# One thing to notice here is that it works in forward direction i.e first executes the task
 and then calls the function calls
# To the examples used, printing 1 to N or N to 1 , we are first printing the number and then
 calling the method. But in scenario, if we cant use addition in first and substraction in second
 how do we approach the problem? i.e. cant do i++ or n--.
# The answer to above question is "Backtracking". The approach is similar to recursion but we just
 call the function before the actual print statement i.e. it works backwards.
